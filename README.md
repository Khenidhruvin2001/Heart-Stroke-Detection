# Heart Stroke Detection Using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in individuals based on various health-related features. By analyzing data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart disease history, and other factors, the model classifies individuals as high or low risk for a stroke.

## Key Features:
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes medical data such as age, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking habits, and more.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to build predictive models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability and generalization.

## Objective:
The main goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in predicting stroke risks early, thereby enabling timely interventions to reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Installation:
To install and run this project, follow these steps:
