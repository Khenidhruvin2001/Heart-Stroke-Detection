# Heart-Stroke-Detection

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in individuals based on various health-related factors. By analyzing features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart disease history, and more, the model predicts whether a person is at high or low risk for a stroke.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project uses a medical dataset that includes relevant health data such as age, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking habits, and more.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build predictive models.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values to prepare the dataset for training.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
Objective:
The main goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a reliable, data-driven approach for early stroke risk detection, potentially reducing the chances of a severe stroke outcome through timely intervention.

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
